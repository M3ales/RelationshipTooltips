# Relationship Tooltips [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/298040.svg)](https://stardewvalley.curseforge.com/projects/298040)
A tooltip mod which displays NPC friendship/relationship information on mouse hover, as well as gifting information.
## Features
### Gifting
Gifting is tracked while the mod is installed, and suggestions on responses for gifts that have been given will be made. This can optionally be turned off to provide a wiki like companion which tells you exactly what everyone wants. To disable you will need to set the property ```playerKnowsAllGifts=true``` in ```StardewValley>Mods>RelationshipTooltips>config.json```

### Farm Animals
Farm Animals now display tooltips which let you know your friendship (heart level) with them, as well as if you've petted them today - via tooltip.

### Pets
Pets display a simple nametag on hover, because we already know your pet loves you :3.
